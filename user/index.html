              <p>We are happy to provide you a few options to pay for your ticket and upgrade. The easiest way would be to bank transfer to our bank account.
                That way you make sure you don't pay any extra fees or have to have an account at another website. If bank transfer is not possible or you want to pay with Credit Card/Sofort/Ideal, we have good news.
                For those options you can pay via Transferwire. Transferwire is accepting all kinds of payment options for a low fee. Some are even free like Sofort and iDeal.
                It is also possible to directly convert money from other currencies to euros with the rate you see on Google.</p>

              <p><strong>How does Transferwire work?</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>If you want to use one of the other payment options you do have to create an account at Transferwire. You can also use your Google or Facebook account for it.
                There is no extra identy check needed if you want to send money to us. Simply click on Send Money and use our IBAN to make sure it goes to the right account. Check their website for more information.</p>

                If after a week after paying nothing has been updated, make sure all the information you entered was correct. If it was correct, send us an email with a proof of payment to us so we can sort it out for you.
