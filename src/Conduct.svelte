    We want to build the best party ever for you. To make sure that everything
    runs smoothly and fun we have a few rules for everyone. Please make yourself
    familiar with them. Most are common sense but we still want to be sure you
    know what to expect.

    The rules will be enforced by the Security Staff. Please listen to them at
    all times and follow their requests. If you have any problem with one of the
    security members, please let one of the party staff members know.
