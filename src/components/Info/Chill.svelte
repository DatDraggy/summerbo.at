    in Hamburch seggt man 'schüss! Wouldn't it be great to have a smaller, relaxed cruise with friends, chill music and drinks around different parts of Hamburg?
    The numbers don't lie, furries love boating, which is why last year we've come up with an additional opportunity to get on the water with this years newest addition being a second, second boat! On Sunday {departTimeChill.toLocaleDateString('en-US', {month: 'long'})} {departTimeChill.getDate()}, {departTimeChill.getFullYear()} at {departTimeChill.toLocaleTimeString('de-DE', {hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit'})},
    we'll be boarding TWO Barkassen at Überseebrücke for a nice 3 hour trip to other parts of Hamburg.

    Our boats offer two different experiences to choose from while happening at the same time:<br>
    <strong>Tunes</strong>: Live DJ music, vibe with friends, enjoy the scenery<br>
    <strong>Talky</strong>: Background music, chat with friends, possibly guided harbour tour<br>
    Boarding, departure and arrival are identical for both boats.

    These <strong>smaller boats</strong> each offer half the capacity of our party boat and will primarily happen seated.
    They're equipped with a <strong>bar for drinks and snacks</strong> with table service, plenty of cider and chill music.
    However, due to the size and type of the event, we <strong>won't be able to provide a fursuit lounge</strong>. Take a partial or stay suited during the entire cruise (emergency unsuiting possible in restrooms).
