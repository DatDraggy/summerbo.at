  <Accordion question="How will the new digital entrance ticket work?">
    <p>
      Before boarding, you will need to provide your digital ticket from your email or browser in combination with your legal ID/passport.
      After boarding, it will not be possible to be re-boarded, so please stay on the boat, otherwise we won't be able to allow you back on.

  <Accordion question="Will I still be able to get a con badge for Summerbo.at?">

    <p>
      You're able to select which boat (tunes or talky) you want to be part of and can change your wish at any time, provided there is enough capacity.<br>
      When both boats slots are filled, you can organize a swap with an attendee whishing to swap to your boat. Send us an email.<br><br>

      All other details (location, boarding, departure) are identical. We'll have clear signage to guide you to your designated boat where your entrance ticket will be checked.

  <Accordion question="Where do the profits of the party go to?"
    ><p>
      Our money is managed by the legal entity Eurofurence e.V. which is
      unable to take any profits for other purposes than the event itself.
      Leftover money will be rolled over as a reserve for next years party
      or donated to charity, which we'll be announcing transparently.
      In previous years, we donated ALL the money we made from VIP upgrades to charity,
      but due to the move to Hamburg and global crises, we'll actually use it to support
      the party to be able to not raise prices too much for our regular attendees.

  <Accordion question="How did the party come to be?">
    <p>
      In <a href="https://2019.summerbo.at/" target="_blank">2019</a> some friends
      wanted to do something special for celebrating the 25th edition of Eurofurence
      and the 5th edition in Berlin, the city that knows how to party! So why not
      on a boat? Cruising on the beautiful Spree River through Berlin. We wanted
      a chill atmosphere for partying and suiting up.
