  <Accordion question="Where do the profits of the party go to?"
    ><p>
      Our money is managed by the legal entity Eurofurence e.V. which is
      unable to take any profits for other purposes than the event itself.
      Leftover money will be rolled over as a reserve for next years party
      or donated to charity, which we'll be announcing transparently.
      In previous years, we donated ALL the money we made from VIP upgrades to charity,
      but due to the move to Hamburg and global crises, we'll actually use it to support
      the party to be able to not raise prices too much for our regular attendees.

  <Accordion question="How did the party come to be?">
    <p>
      In <a href="https://2019.summerbo.at/" target="_blank">2019</a> some friends
      wanted to do something special for celebrating the 25th edition of Eurofurence
      and the 5th edition in Berlin, the city that knows how to party! So why not
      on a boat? Cruising on the beautiful Spree River through Berlin. We wanted
      a chill atmosphere for partying and suiting up.
