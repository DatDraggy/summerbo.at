  <h2 id="privacy" class="text-headline"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
  <p>Last updated: January 3, 2020</p>
  <p>
    We believe that being as transparent as possible about collecting and
    processing is the most important thing in maintaining a good relationship
    with our attendees and users. Because of this we hope you feel safe to use
    our website and services.
  </p>
  <p>That is the basic purpose of this privacy policy.</p>
  <h3 class="textLarge">
    <strong>1.</strong> Basic information you share with us
  </h3>
  <p>
    To make sure we can do our job, we require some information from you, the
    user. The information is used to make sure that we can deliver the services
    to you. For example the right badge, making sure the right people are at the
    party and we can share the list of attendees with emergency departments in
    case of an emergency.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge"><strong>1.1</strong> Public information</h3>
  <p>
    Some information or details you give to us will be used public. On the
    website or in physical form. Think about your Nickname, Registration Number,
    Fursuiter info, Sponsor and Country. The Nickname will be used on the badge
    and on the website. Your Nickname can also be put on the public available
    Attendee List. More information about that is found in chapter 1.1.1 or on
    the page of the attendee list itself.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge"><strong>1.1.1</strong> Attendee List</h3>
  <p>
    The Attendee list is a listy where all the Nicknames of the attendees will
    be displayed for the party. This option is automatically ticked during the
    registration but can be turned off during registration or later on the user
    page. You are always welcome to remove yourself from the list, via the user
    page or by sending an e-mail to us.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge"><strong>1.1.2</strong> Tracking</h3>
  <p>
    To better understand the usage of our website, we use <a
      href="https://matomo.org/why-matomo/">Matomo</a
    > to collect anonymized data about when and how often our website is accessed.
    This helps us to scale up to the needed infrastructure to prevent further "Laden"
    incidents on the day of the registration opening. Our matomo instance is completely
    hosted by us, so the data stays with your Summerbo.at Team at all times. It is
    also not possible to get any personally identifying information about individuals
    on our website.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge">
    <strong>1.1.2.1</strong> What We Collect and Receive
  </h3>
  <p>
    When you visit our site, we will store: the website from which you visited
    us from, the parts of our site you visit, the date and duration of your
    visit, your anonymised IP address (last two segments nulled, e.g.
    149.233.0.0), information from the device (device type, operating system,
    screen resolution, language, country you are located in, and web browser
    type) you used during your visit and when you leave our site. We process
    this usage data in Matomo Analytics for statistical purposes, to improve our
    site and to recognize and stop any misuse.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge" id="optout">
    <strong>1.1.2.2</strong> Opt-out of website tracking
  </h3>
  <p>
    You can opt out of being tracked by our Matomo Analytics instance by
    enabling your browsers "DoNotTrack" setting or below:
  </p>
  <iframe
    title="Tracking Optout"
    style="border: 0; height:160px; width: 350px;"
    src="https://stats.summerbo.at/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&amp;action=optOut&amp;language=en&amp;backgroundColor=&amp;fontColor=&amp;fontSize=&amp;fontFamily=Arial"
  />
  <h3 class="textLarge"><strong>1.2</strong> Private information</h3>
  <p>
    We also request a few private details to make sure that during the party and
    registration it is really you. The following information is used only
    private and not shared to any other instance/company or used outside of our
    system. We are using the First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Password and
    Email address only for legal purposes. <br />
    The first and last name are used to make sure that during the badge pickup it’s
    the correct person who is standing in front of us. Therefore we also request
    you to bring an ID to check. <br />
    The Date of Birth is used to make sure you are really the legal age of 18 on
    the day of the party. <br />
    Password is stored hashed so we do not have access to the real password. For
    more information regarding passwords, check chapter 1.2.1. <br />
    Email is used for sending emails regarding the registration and important information
    about the party only. We do not share your email address or subscribe you to
    newsletters or useless mail.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge"><strong>1.2.1</strong> Passwords</h3>
  <p>
    Passwords are hashed and stored in our database. To insure the safety of
    your password, it's being hashed using SHA1 (storing uses a different
    algorithm) and the first 5 characters of that hash are sent to
    https://haveibeenpwned.com/. It then returns all leaked passwords starting
    with those 5 characters which the regsystem compares with your hashed
    password. If the password you try to use was leaked before, the system will
    reject the password. We do that to encourage you to use safe passwords.
    After the registration is submitted we do not share the hashed passwords
    with any instance.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge"><strong>1.3</strong> Payment information</h3>
  <p>
    We do not store your payment information in our database. All the details we
    receive from the banks and users will stay in the bank system. With the
    information we see in the bank system we change the payment status in our
    system. The payment status and amount are stored in our database and are
    only used within the system itself. For example to send a reminder email or
    status update.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge"><strong>1.4</strong> Third Parties</h3>
  <p>
    We do not share any information you give to us to third parties. We believe
    that sharing information without consent is against our moral. Therefore we
    do not use tracking or analytical cookies or codes on our website. We do not
    know who you are as long as you are not registered and logged in on our
    website.
  </p>
  <h3 class="textLarge"><strong>1.5</strong> Google ReCAPTCHA</h3>
  <p>
    We as summerbo.at are using Google ReCAPTCHA to check and prevent automated
    servers (“Bots”) from interacting and accessing our website or server. The
    service is provided by Google. (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,

    data protection regulations and therefore we have chosen to use there
    services.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this service to work correctly, Google needs some information about the
    user who is active on the website. This is not information from our database
    itself. Think about IP-addresses and cookie information.
  </p>
  <p>
    This service allows Google to determine from which website your request has
    been sent and from which IP address the reCAPTCHA input box has been used.
    In addition to your IP address, Google may collect other information
    necessary to provide and guarantee this service.
