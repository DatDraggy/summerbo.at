			<h2  id="privacy" class="headline">Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>Last updated: January 3, 2020</p>
			<p>We believe that being as transparent as possible about collecting and processing is the most important thing in maintaining a good relationship with our attendees and users. Because of this we hope you feel safe to use our website and services.</p>

			<p>That is the basic purpose of this privacy policy.</p>

			<p><strong>1.</strong> Basic information you share with us</p>
			<p>To make sure we can do our job, we require some information from you, the user. The information is used to make sure that we can deliver the services to you. For example the right badge, making sure the right people are at the party and we can share the list of attendees with emergency departments in case of an emergency.</p>

			<p><strong>1.1</strong> Public information</p>
			<p>Some information or details you give to us will be used public. On the website or in physical form. Think about your Nickname, Registration Number, Fursuiter info, Sponsor and Country. The Nickname will be used on the badge and on the website. Your Nickname can also be put on the public available Attendee List. More information about that is found in chapter 1.1.1 or on the page of the attendee list itself.</p>

			<p><strong>1.1.1</strong> Attendee List</p>
			<p>The Attendee list is a listy where all the Nicknames of the attendees will be displayed for the party. This option is automatically ticked during the registration but can be turned off during registration or later on the user page. You are always welcome to remove yourself from the list, via the user page or by sending an e-mail to us.</p>

      <p><strong>1.1.2</strong> Tracking</p>
      <p>To better understand the usage of our website, we use <a href="https://matomo.org/why-matomo/">Matomo</a> to collect anonymized data about when and how often our website is accessed. This helps us to scale up to the needed infrastructure to prevent further "Laden" incidents on the day of the registration opening.
      Our matomo instance is completely hosted by us, so the data stays with your Summerbo.at Team at all times. It is also not possible to get any personally identifying information about individuals on our website.</p>

      <p><strong>1.1.2.1</strong> What We Collect and Receive</p>
      <p>When you visit our site, we will store: the website from which you visited us from, the parts of our site you visit, the date and duration of your visit, your anonymised IP address (last two segments nulled, e.g. 149.233.0.0), information from the device (device type, operating system, screen resolution, language, country you are located in, and web browser type) you used during your visit and when you leave our site. We process this usage data in Matomo Analytics for statistical purposes, to improve our site and to recognize and stop any misuse.</p>

      <p id="optout"><strong>1.1.2.2</strong> Opt-out of website tracking</p>
      <p>You can opt out of being tracked by our Matomo Analytics instance by enabling your browsers "DoNotTrack" setting or below:</p>
        <iframe
          style="border: 0; height: 220px; width: auto;"
          src="https://stats.summerbo.at/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en&backgroundColor=&fontColor=&fontSize=&fontFamily=Arial"
        ></iframe>

      <p><strong>1.2</strong> Private information</p>
			<p>We also request a few private details to make sure that during the party and registration it is really you. The following information is used only private and not shared to any other instance/company or used outside of our system. We are using the First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Password and Email address only for legal purposes. <br>
			The first and last name are used to make sure that during the badge pickup it’s the correct person who is standing in front of us. Therefore we also request you to bring an ID to check. <br>
			The Date of Birth is used to make sure you are really the legal age of 18 on the day of the party. <br>
			Password is stored hashed so we do not have access to the real password. For more information regarding passwords, check chapter 1.2.1. <br>
			Email is used for sending emails regarding the registration and important information about the party only. We do not share your email address or subscribe you to newsletters or useless mail.</p>

			<p><strong>1.2.1</strong> Passwords</p>
			<p>Passwords are hashed and stored in our database. To insure the safety of your password, it's being hashed using
        SHA1 (storing uses a different algorithm) and the first 5 characters of that hash are sent to https://haveibeenpwned.com/. It then
        returns all leaked passwords starting with those 5 characters which the regsystem compares with your hashed password.
        If the password you try to use was leaked before, the system will reject the password.
        We do that to encourage you to use safe passwords. After the registration is submitted we do not share the hashed passwords with any instance.</p>


			<p><strong>1.3</strong> Payment information</p>
			<p>We do not store your payment information in our database. All the details we receive from the banks and users will stay in the bank system. With the information we see in the bank system we change the payment status in our system. The payment status and amount are stored in our database and are only used within the system itself. For example to send a reminder email or status update.</p>


			<p><strong>1.4</strong> Third Parties</p>
			<p>We do not share any information you give to us to third parties. We believe that sharing information without consent is against our moral. Therefore we do not use tracking or analytical cookies or codes on our website. We do not know who you are as long as you are not registered and logged in on our website.</p>

			<p><strong>1.5</strong> Google ReCAPTCHA</p>
			<p>We as summerbo.at are using Google ReCAPTCHA to check and prevent automated servers (“Bots”) from interacting and accessing our website or server. The service is provided by Google. (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043). This company guarantees that it will follow all EU data protection regulations and therefore we have chosen to use there services.</p>
			<p>For this service to work correctly, Google needs some information about the user who is active on the website. This is not information from our database itself. Think about IP-addresses and cookie information.</p>
			<p>This service allows Google to determine from which website your request has been sent and from which IP address the reCAPTCHA input box has been used. In addition to your IP address, Google may collect other information necessary to provide and guarantee this service.</p>
			<p>If you want more detailed information about the Privacy Policy of Google or the ReCAPTCHA Privacy Policy, you can find so at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
