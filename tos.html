			<h2>Cookie Usage</h2>
			<p>The website summerbo.at is using a total of 3 cookies. These cookies are mandatory for the usage of the website. Below you will find the specific cookies we use and the reason why we are using them.</p>

			<p><strong>PHPSESSID</strong></p>
			<p>This cookie is used to make sure that our php scripts keep on working. Think about the registration and login pages that use PHP to post or request info from our database. Also the attendee list and countdown use PHP to make sure they give the right information.</p>

			<p><strong>cookieconsent_dismissed</strong></p>
			<p>This cookie is used to save that you pressed the Accept cookie button. Otherwise it would ask every time you open the website to accept the cookies. There is no reject button because all the cookies we use are mandatory to have a functional website.</p>

			<p><strong>cfduid</strong></p>
			<p>The __cfduid cookie is used to identify individual clients behind a shared IP address and apply security settings on a per-client basis.
			For example, if a visitor is in a coffee shop where there may be several infected machines, but the specific visitor's machine is trusted (for example, because they completed a challenge within your Challenge Passage period), the cookie allows Cloudflare to identify that client and not challenge them again. It does not correspond to any user ID in your web application, and does not store any personally identifiable information.</p>

			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>Last updated: January 3, 2019</p>
			<p>We believe that being as transparent as possible about collecting and processing is the most important thing in maintaining a good relationship with our attendees and users. Because of this we hope you feel safe to use our website and services.</p>

			<p>That is the basic purpose of this privacy policy.</p>
			
			<p><strong>1.</strong> Basic information you share with us</p>
			<p>To make sure we can do our job, we require some information from you, the user. The information is used to make sure that we can deliver the services to you. For example the right badge, making sure the right people are at the party and we can share the list of attendees with emergency departments in case of an emergency.</p>

			<p><strong>1.1</strong> Public information</p>
			<p>Some information or details you give to us will be used public. On the website or in physical form. Think about your Nickname, Registration Number, Fursuiter info, Sponsor and Country. The Nickname will be used on the badge and on the website. Your Nickname can also be put on the public available Attendee List. More information about that is found in chapter 1.1.1 or on the page of the attendee list itself.</p>

			<p><strong>1.1.1</strong> Attendee List</p>
			<p>The Attendee list is a listy where all the Nicknames of the attendees will be displayed for the party. This option is automatically ticked during the registration but can be turned off during registration or later on the user page. You are always welcome to remove yourself from the list, via the user page or by sending an e-mail to us.</p>


			<p><strong>1.2</strong> Private information</p>
			<p>We also request a few private details to make sure that during the party and registration it is really you. The following information is used only private and not shared to any other instance/company or used outside of our system. We are using the First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Password and Email address only for legal purposes. <br>
			The first and last name are used to make sure that during the badge pickup it’s the correct person who is standing in front of us. Therefore we also request you to bring an ID to check. <br>
			The Date of Birth is used to make sure you are really the legal age of 18 on the day of the party. <br>
			Password is stored hashed so we do not have access to the real password. For more information regarding passwords, check chapter 1.2.1. <br>
			Email is used for sending emails regarding the registration and important information about the party only. We do not share your email address or subscribe you to newsletters or useless mail.</p>

			<p><strong>1.2.1</strong> Passwords</p>
			<p>Passwords are hashed and stored in an encrypted database. Only the 5 first digits/characters are sent to https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to check during registration if the password you try to use is leaked before. We do that to encourage you to use safe passwords. After the registration is submitted we do not share the hashed passwords with any instance.</p>


			<p><strong>1.3</strong> Payment information</p>
			<p>We do not store your payment information in our database. All the details we receive from the banks and users will stay in the bank system. With the information we see in the bank system we change the payment status in our system. The payment status and amount are stored in our database and are only used within the system itself. For example to send a reminder email or status update.</p>


			<p><strong>1.4</strong> Third Parties</p>
			<p>We do not share any information you give to us to third parties. We believe that sharing information without consent is against our moral. Therefore we do not use tracking or analytical cookies or codes on our website. We do not know who you are as long as you are not registered and logged in on our website.</p>

			<p><strong>2</strong> Managing your personal data with us</p>
			<p>You are always in control of the data you share with us. It is always possible to review, edit or delete the data. We make it also easy for you to contact us about your personal data and the usage of it.</p>
 
			<p><strong>2.1</strong> Accessing or Rectifying Your Personal Data</p>
			<p>The moment you register with us you have access to tools to view and edit your personal information. You can also request via several ways your download in portable form. Please refer to 2.4 - Portability for more information about that subject.</p>

			<p><strong>2.2</strong> Deletion</p>
			<p>You as user has always the right to request deletion of your data. The request can be sent in several ways. Via email by sending a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@summerbo.at">privacy@summerbo.at</a>, by asking one of the Admins in the Telegram group <a href="https://t.me/summerboat">@summerboat</a>, or sending a Direct Message to our Twitter Account <a href="https://www.twitter.com/summerbo_at">@Summerbo_at.</a></p>

			<p>Keep in mind that upon deletion of your data it is not possible to use our services and attend the party.</p>

			<p><strong>2.2.1</strong> Auto Deletion of user Data</p>
			<p>There are cases that we are deleting the data of our users without receiving a request from the user itself. This happens 14 days after the date of the party/event itself. After that date it is also not possible to request the data as a portable form.
			The other case is if the the registration for an event is canceled due to payment or other reasons. All data will be deleted except the registration number. This is to make sure it’s still an unique number for the database.</p>

			<p><strong>2.3</strong> Object, Restrict, or Withdraw Consent</p>
			<p>Users are always allowed to object, restrict or withdraw consent given to summerbo.at. This means that if you do not agree with our Terms or Privacy policy you can let us remove your personal information or for example remove your nickname from the public attendee list.</p>

			<p><strong>2.4</strong> Portability</p>
			<p>Every user is allowed to request his or hers personal information in a portable form. We will make sure you receive the information as soon as possible on the email you have provided to us. The information will be in a readable format with explanation of all data that we used.</p>

			<p><strong>2.4.1</strong> Requesting the data</p>
			<p>Your own data can be requested by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@summerbo.at">privacy@summerbo.at</a>. We will reply within 2 working days with all the information we have about you in our system in a readable format.</p>
