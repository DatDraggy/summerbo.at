			and we will have a fursuit lounge with basic supplies. Water for suiters is provided, but please don't
		        bring your own drinks. We do understand that you maybe don't want to suit
		        during the whole trip. Simply change out of suit and we keep guard. </p>

		    Also it will bring us all back there. Please mind that check-in (getting your badge and goodies) will be
		    done before boarding and also close to the hotel. More info about that will be released later.

                <p>The chance of getting seasick on this boat is very minimal. This is because the speed and the size of
                  the boat make it impossible to feel any waves from other boats on the Spree. We do advise to talk with
                  your doctor in case you get seasick very easily. It will be smooth sailing!</p>
