            <p>The Hot Summer Nights 2020 Boat will depart at 19:00 CEST, starting from the Estrel hotel.
			For 4 hours we will entertain you with music, events and a beautiful sightseeing over the Spree river in Berlin.</p>

		  <h4 style="color:#fe316e">Location</h4>
            <p>The location is one of the larger ships of the Stern und Kreis Company. All ships are equipped with a bar,

		  <div class="ticket ticketQuartery content content33">
		  <h4 style="color:#fe316e">Drinks</h4>
            <p>On the boat we have a fully equipped bar with all kinds of drinks available.
			Want a drink after fursuiting or dancing? No problem! The bar accepts cash and card payments
		        and is operated by the ship company &ndash; You can't bring your own drinks.</p>

			and we will have a fursuit lounge with basic supplies. Water for suiters is provided, but please don't
		        bring your own drinks. We do understand that you maybe don't want to suit
		        during the whole trip. Simply change out of suit and we keep guard. </p>

		  <h4 style="color:#fe316e">Transport</h4>

		    Also it will bring us all back there. Please mind that check-in (getting your badge and goodies) will be
		    done before boarding and also close to the hotel. More info about that will be released later.

                  We wanted to do something special for celebrating the 25th edition of Eurofurence and the 5th edition
 		  in Berlin, the city that knows how to party! So why not on a boat? We can show you around Berlin via
		  the beautiful Spree river and in the mean time chill, party and suit up. Basically we have a fursuitwalk
		  (without walking) and party in one. Throw in a beautiful sunset and the best DJs and it's a perfect
		  experience you don't want to miss.
